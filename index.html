                <p>Post-war immigration significantly reshaped Australia's population and cultural landscape, as the
                    country welcomed large numbers of migrants to boost its workforce and economy. This period
                    eventually
                    led to the dismantling of the White Australia Policy, marking a shift toward a more multicultural
                    society.

                <p>Post-war immigration was a major part of what influenced the change of the immigration laws, and
                    subsequently, “White Australia”. One of the related laws was the Immigration Act, it was a law in
                    Australia, although spread across different countries that regulated and tightened the restrictions
                    of who was allowed in. Based on nationality, skills or family connections. The immigration act
                    was introduced in December of 1901, it was actually one of the first laws passed the new
                    federal parliament after Australia's federation. One of the ways they got people to vote
                    was through propaganda and speechs from members of the parliament. An example would be
                    John "The Big Fella" Thomas Lang, a former member of parliament (from 1925 -> 1927 &
                    1930 -> 1932)</p>

                <p>Bad immigration laws targeted non-European immigrants, especially Asian and Pacific Islander
                    immigrants by putting harsh restrictions on their entry. An example would be the dictation test,
                    which was introduced in a policy similar to White Australia which required potential immigrants to
                    write a piece of writing using a European language. It was mainly used to purposely exclude people
                    even if they met all the other requirements and limited non-European immigration. It impatced
                    the migrants negatively due to the fact that it meant they weren't able to flee their countries
                    in case of conflict, political overrule and other forms of bad things in their home country.
                    However one alleged upside of the White Australia policy is that higher wagers were in place
                    due to less workers, because of a lower population meaning people got paid more. Which
                    is statistically better for the economy and housing prices.</p>

            <section class="info-card">
                <p>The White Australia policy was ended due to people's views on race changing. It was influenced by
                    some other countries and the need for a better workforce. It led to more inclusive immigration that
                    let non-European immigrants settle into Australia. It also allowed immigrants to have new chances
                    for work, schooling although racism still existed. Some citizens didn't like the new changes and
                    some feared change in culture and harder times getting work. But others thought it was good. One
                    of the key causes of the change was also through the Whitlam Government. In 1973
                    the Whitlam Labor Government who definetively renounced the White Australia policy
                    and put a policy of multiculturalism in its place to help popularise multiculturalism.
                    Some people didn't like it due to the fact that one of the reasons they opened the borders
                    being for cheap labor. More immigrants = higher population = more workers = lower wages = cheap
                    labor</p>
