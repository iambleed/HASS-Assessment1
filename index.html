                <p>Post-war immigration significantly reshaped Australia's population and cultural landscape, as the
                country welcomed large numbers of migrants to boost its workforce and economy. This period eventually
                led to the dismantling of the White Australia Policy, marking a shift toward a more multicultural
                society.</p>

                <p>Post-war immigration was a major part of what influenced the change of the immigration laws, and
                    subsequently, “White Australia”. One of the related laws was the Immigration Act, it was a law in
                    Australia, although spread across different countries that regulated and tightened the restrictions
                    of who was allowed in. Based on nationality, skills or family connections.</p>

                <p>Bad immigration laws targeted non-European immigrants, especially Asian and Pacific Islander
                    immigrants by putting harsh restrictions on their entry. An example would be the dictation test,
                    which was introduced in a policy similar to White Australia which required potential immigrants to
                    write a piece of writing using a European language. It was mainly used to purposely exclude people
                    even if they met all the other requirements and limited non-European immigration.</p>

            <section class="info-card">
                <p>The White Australia policy was ended due to people's views on race changing. It was influenced by
                    some other countries and the need for a better workforce. It led to more inclusive immigration that
                    let non-European immigrants settle into Australia. It also allowed immigrants to have new chances
                    for work, schooling although racism still existed. Some citizens didn't like the new changes and
                    some feared change in culture and harder times getting work. But others thought it was good.</p>

                <p>Today, Australia is one of the most multicultural countries in the world, with a mix of languages,
                    traditions, and communities that shape its identity, economy, and values.</p>
